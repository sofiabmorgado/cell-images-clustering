# cell-images-clustering

This repository focuses on clustering images that contain cells in different parts of their division cycle. 

Several machine learning techniques were implemented, for both feature extraction, feature selection, and clustering, to analyze a collection of bacterial cell images. Feature extraction included Principal Component Analysis and TSNE; for the feature selection, ANOVA, the feature correlation matrix and mutual information were implemented; for the clustering, DBSCAN, K-means and the Gaussian Mixture Model were used.
